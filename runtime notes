extra large array runtime: insert 1.0359s, append 3.4071ms
tiny array: insert 44.2us, append 90.4us
small array: insert 56.1us, append 110.1 us
medium array: insert 327.4us, append 303.2us
large array: insert 13.0144ms, append 654us

as the arrays got bigger the runtimes took longer to finish, the extra large array
should have taken around half a second to 3/4s of a second and the append took way longer
than any of the other arrays it is definitely the slowest the reason why it could be slower is because it 
has to run a bigger array than any of the other functions. the tiny and small functions were the fastest because 
they didnt have to push such a high number.
